# Language Overview

The language will be very simple to make it easy to implement. Currently it will implement the following operations:
 - Addition (+ a b c ...) - adds all variables a, b, c ...
 - Subtraction (- a b c ...) - subtracts the value of all variables after the first from the first variable. Equivalent to (- a (+ b c ...))

# Formal Specification

The following products define the language:
 - *Program* -> *E*
 - *E* -> ( *E* *Es* )
 - *E* -> *Atom*
 - *Atom* -> Number
 - *Es* -> *E* *Es*
 - *Es* -> Ïµ

Planned additions to the language include:
 - Basic predefined arithmatic operators (`+` and `-`)
 - Macros and primitives (macros written in C)

Comments can be added with a semicolon `;`, like so:

    (+ 1 2 3)    ;should evaluate to 6

Comments are not considered tokens, and as such will only appear in source code.


# File Types

 - .jlisp - source code
 - .jtoken - annotated list of tokens output by the tokenizer, each on their own line

# Intermediate File Formats

# .jtoken

.jtoken files are produced by the tokenizer and read by the parser.
Each token_t is on a separate line, which is broken up into three parts:
 - An integer reflecting the type of the token_t (number, id, etc.)
 - An integer reflecting which line of the source code this token_t is from
 - A string which is the actual text of the token_t
